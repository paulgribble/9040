## Setup

First, if you don't have a GitHub account already, go and sign up for a (free) [GitHub](https://www.github.com) account.

Then, double-check that you have installed git as part of the [setup](01b_setup.qmd) instructions. Open up a terminal and type:

```{bash}
git --version
```

and you should get something like:

```{bash}
git version 2.34.0
```

It doesn't much matter if the version number isn't identical to the one above.

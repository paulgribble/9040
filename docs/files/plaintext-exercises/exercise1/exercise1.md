# Introduction

Caffeine is the most widely consumed psychoactive substance in the
world [@fredholm1999actions]. Its effects on cognitive performance
are well-documented, but effects on motor performance remain less
clear. Some evidence suggests that caffeine may enhance muscular
force production through increased motor unit recruitment
[@kalmar2004caffeine].

The present study examined whether a moderate dose of caffeine
(200 mg) increases maximal isometric grip strength in healthy
young adults.

# Methods

## Participants

We recruited 30 healthy adults (15 female, mean age = 23.1 years,
SD = 3.4) from the university community. Participants reported no
history of cardiovascular disease and were regular caffeine consumers
(1--3 cups of coffee per day). All participants provided written
informed consent.

## Procedure

Participants attended two testing sessions separated by at least 48
hours, in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design. At
each session, participants completed three maximal voluntary
contractions (MVCs) on a Jamar hydraulic hand dynamometer using
their dominant hand. They then consumed a capsule containing either
200 mg caffeine or a placebo (cellulose). After a 45-minute
absorption period, they completed three more MVCs.

  YOUR TASK: Add a new subsection here called "Data Analysis"
  
  In this subsection:
  1. Write 2-3 sentences describing how the data were analyzed
     (e.g., a paired-samples t-test comparing change scores)
  2. Include an inline equation for the t-statistic:
     t = (X̄ - μ) / (s / √n)
     In LaTeX math notation: $t = \frac{\bar{X} - \mu}{s / \sqrt{n}}$
  3. Cite at least one new reference (add it to refs.bib first)
  
  Hint: To add a subsection, use ### Data Analysis
  Hint: Inline math goes between single dollar signs: $...$

# Results

Mean grip strength increased by 2.3 N (SD = 4.1) in the caffeine
condition and 0.4 N (SD = 3.8) in the placebo condition. The
difference between conditions was statistically significant,
$t(29) = 2.18$, $p = .038$, $d = 0.40$.

# Discussion

These results suggest a small but statistically significant positive
effect of caffeine on maximal grip strength, consistent with previous
meta-analytic findings [@warren2010effect]. The effect size ($d = 0.40$)
is in line with what has been reported for caffeine's ergogenic effects
on strength tasks.

Limitations include the relatively homogeneous sample (university
students, habitual caffeine consumers) and the use of a single dose.
Future research should examine dose--response relationships and
whether the effect generalizes to dynamic strength tasks.

Linux is the gold standard in scientific computing environments; most computing clusters, cloud servers, and neuroimaging pipelines run on it, so familiarity with its command line is invaluable. MacOS runs on a Unix variant under the hood, meaning the terminal experience is nearly identical, making it a convenient choice for researchers who want a polished laptop environment that translates well to work on Linux/Unix environments such as servers and clusters.\n\nWindows has historically been the odd one out for scientific computing, but the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) has changed this dramatically. The WSL lets you run a full Linux environment inside Windows, giving you access to the same tools and workflows. For our purposes, the key is having a working terminal and Python environment.\n\nSo if you are already using Unix/Linux, good news, you are all set, just some configuration things and some package installs and your computing environment will be ready for a modern course in coding / scientific computing.\n\nIf you are using MacOS, also good news, you may not know it but MacOS is based on a Unix variant, so with some small configuration things and some package installs, you will also be ready.\n\nIf you are using Windows, it will be ok. Something we will cover in this course is learning to use the terminal, learning about file systems, files, directories, and so on. On Linux/Unix and on MacOS (which is based on Unix) this is straightforward and you won't need to do anything particularly special. On Windows however you will need to do some initial setup to install something called the *Windows Subsystem for Linux* (WSL). This will enable you to launch a Linux session within Windows, and follow along in the course with everyone else. It's not such a big deal. Instructions are below.\n\nPS: Personally I am most familiar with MacOS and Unix/Linux. I am quite unfamiliar with Windows.\n\n### Unix/Linux\n\nOpen up an Ubuntu terminal and (assuming Ubuntu Linux) update the system:\n\n```{bash}\nsudo apt update\nsudo apt upgrade -y\n```\n\nand then install some necessary tools including git:\n\n```{bash}\nsudo apt install -y build-essential git curl\n```\n\nand then install the uv tool:\n\n```{bash}\ncurl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh\n```\n\nclose your Terminal.\n\nand then download [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download) and install it.\n\n### MacOS\n\nOpen up a terminal and install some necessary build tools:\n\n```{bash}\nxcode-select --install\n```\n\nInstall the Homebrew package manager:\n\n```{bash}\n/bin/bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)\"\n```\n\nThen close the terminal and open up a new one, and install some other necessary tools including git:\n\n```{bash}\nbrew install git\n```\n\nThen install the uv tool:\n\n```{bash}\ncurl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh\n```\n\nclose your Terminal.\n\nand then download [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download) and install it.\n\nIf you want a nicer looking Terminal than the one that ships with MacOS you can try one of these:\n\n- [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/)\n- [ghostty](https://ghostty.org/)\n\n### Windows\n\nFirst update Windows, I think you can access this by going to the Start menu and typing \"update\" and one of the options will be a system update.\n\nNext, open up Powershell (again, go to the Start menu and type Powershell to access it) and type:\n\n```{bash}\nwsl --install\n```\n\nWhen it is done, reboot your computer.\n\nOpen up Powershell again and type:\n\n```{bash}\nwsl.exe --install Ubuntu\n```\n\nIt will eventually ask you for a default Unix user account and password.\n\nClose Powershell and any other junky windows that Windows may have opened.\n\nOpen Powershell and check to see which version of WSL is running:\n\n```{bash}\nwsl -l -v\n```\n\nif it shows version 1 instead of version 2 then switch:\n\n```{bash}\nwsl --set-version Ubuntu 2\n```\n\nClose Powershell and reboot the computer.\n\nFrom your Start menu select \"Ubuntu\" and it should launch a terminal, which is now, running Ubuntu linux.\n\nNow go through the steps above in the Unix/Linux section.\n\n## Check your setup\n\nCreate a new folder somewhere on your computer's file system and name it `Psych_9040`, and then navigate inside of it.\n\nOpen Ubuntu:\n\n```{bash}\nmkdir Psych_9040\ncd Psych_9040\n```\n\nUse uv to install a python environment\n\n```{bash}\nuv init --python 3.12\n```\n\nAdd the numpy package\n\n```{bash}\nuv add numpy\n```\n\nCreate a new empty file:\n\n```{bash}\ntouch hello.py\n```\n\nand add some Python lines of code to it:\n\n```{bash}\necho \"import numpy as np\" >> hello.py\necho \"x = np.array ([2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29])\" >> hello.py\necho \"y = np.sum(x)\" >> hello.py\necho \"print(f\\\"the sum of {x} is {y}\\\")\" >> hello.py\n```\n\nand test the code:\n\n```{bash}\nuv run python hello.py\n```\n\nand you should see this output:\n\n```{bash}\nthe sum of [ 2  3  5  7 11 13 17 19 23 29] is 129\n```\n\n## Git/GitHub\n\nWe will be learning about and using code versioning with Git and GitHub, so you should sign up for a (free) [GitHub](https://www.github.com) account.\n\n## Visual Studio Code\n\nAfter installing VS Code, launch it, and enable launching from the terminal.\n\n### MacOS\n\n1. Open VS Code: Launch the Visual Studio Code application.\n2. Install Shell Command by Open the Command Palette by pressing Shift + Command + P (or F1).\n3. Type \"shell command\" into the prompt.\n4. Select the command \"Shell Command: Install 'code' command in PATH\". (You might be prompted for your administrator password.)\n5. Launch from Terminal: Open your terminal. Navigate to the directory of your project. Type the following command:\n\n```{bash}\ncode .\n```\n\nThe . opens the current directory in a new VS Code window. You can replace . with a specific file name or directory path.\n\n### WSL on Windows\n\n1. Launch VS Code in your Windows environment.\n2. Open the Command Palette (Ctrl + Shift + P).\n3. Type \"shell command\" and select \"Shell Command: Install 'code' command in PATH\" if you didn't do so during the initial installation of the Remote - WSL extension. The extension should typically handle this installation, but verifying doesn't hurt.\n4. Launch from WSL Terminal: Open your WSL terminal (e.g., Ubuntu). Navigate to your project directory within the Linux environment. Type the command:\n\n```{bash}\ncode .\n```\n\nThis command will open the current Linux directory in a new VS Code window on your Windows desktop, automatically connecting via the Remote - WSL extension. \n\n",

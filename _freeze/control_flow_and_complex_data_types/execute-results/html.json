We will learn about *loops*, which are constructs that allow you to repeat blocks of code multiple times, typically while changing the values of variables inside the repeating block. We will learn about *conditionals*, which allow you to execute different branches of code depending on the values of variables.\n\n## Readings\n\n- Learning with Python 3 chapter 5: [Conditionals](https://openbookproject.net/thinkcs/python/english3e/conditionals.html#conditionals)\n- Learning with Python 3 chapter 7: [Iteration](https://openbookproject.net/thinkcs/python/english3e/iteration.html#iteration)\n- Python for Data Analysis chapter 3: [Built-in Data Structures, Functions, and Files](https://wesmckinney.com/book/python-builtin.html)\n- Python for Data Analysis chapter 4: [NumPy Basics: Arrays and Vectorized Computation](https://wesmckinney.com/book/numpy-basics.html)\n- Python for Data Analysis chapter 5: [Getting Started with pandas](https://wesmckinney.com/book/pandas-basics.html)\n- [Conditionals and recursion](https://greenteapress.com/thinkpython2/html/thinkpython2006.html) (you can ignore for now the section on recursion)\n- [Control Flow](https://wesmckinney.com/book/python-basics.html#control_flow)\n\n## Loops\n\nLoops are used when you have a chunk of code that you need to repeat\nover and over again, each time changing one (or more) parameters.\n\nThere are two kinds of loops: a **for loop** and a **while loop**. A **for loop** is used when you (or your code) know in advance of starting the loop, how many iterations to run through. A **while loop** is used when the number of iterations is not known in advance of starting the loop. You might use a **for loop** to load in a list of data files. You might use a **while loop** to iterate through an EEG waveform over samples (time) to search for the first value that exceeds some baseline threshold.\n\nHere is a simple example for the purposes of demonstration. Let's say you want to load data from 5 files, named `data1.txt`, `data2.txt`, ..., `data5.txt`. Let's say each file contains a one-dimensional array of 10 values. Let's say you want to take the average of each data file and then report the overall mean and overall variance of those values. Here's one way to do it:\n\n### For loops\n\n::: {#2c53dda6 .cell execution_count=1}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nd1 = load(\"data1.txt\")\nd1m = mean(d1)\nd2 = load(\"data2.txt\")\nd2m = mean(d2)\nd3 = load(\"data3.txt\")\nd3m = mean(d3)\nd4 = load(\"data4.txt\")\nd4m = mean(d4)\nd5 = load(\"data5.txt\")\nd5m = mean(d5)\n\n# report overall mean and overall variance of 5 data file means\nalldata = [d1m, d2m, d3m, d4m, d5m]\ndatamean = mean(alldata)\ndatavar = var(alldata)\nprint(f\"mean={datamean:.3f} and variance={datavar:.3f}\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nYou can see that there is a lot of repetition in this code. What if we had to load data from 1000 data files? There would be a lot of copying and pasting of code chunks. This is error prone and inefficient. Instead let's use a **for loop**. A for loop allows you to repeat a block of code some predetermined number of times, and includes a counter so that you know which iteration of the loop is currently running. Here is what the code above would look like if we used a **for loop**:\n\n::: {#d8ed3dff .cell execution_count=2}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nnfiles = 1000\nalldata = np.zeros(1000)\nfor i in range(nfiles):\n    d = load(\"data\" + str(i) + \".txt\")\n    alldata[i] = mean(d)\ndatamean = mean(alldata)\ndatavar = var(alldata)\nprint(f\"mean={datamean:.3f} and variance={datavar:.3f}\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nNow all we would need to change if we have 1000 data files (or one million) is the value of our variable `nfiles=1000` or `nfiles=1e6 `---nothing else in the code would have to change. This makes our code much more resilient against programming errors.\n\nYou can see a for loop begins with the keyword `for` followed by a name of a variable (your choice) that will keep track of which iteration of the loop is currently running. Then for word `in` followed by a list of values to be iterated through. Next is the block of code to be repeated. Note that in Python, blocks of code like this are denoted using **indentation**. Python is very fussy indeed about indentation.\n\n::: {#3696ef06 .cell execution_count=3}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nfor i in range(1,15,3):\n    print(f\"i={i}\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\ni=1\ni=4\ni=7\ni=10\ni=13\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nFor loops are executed in a serial fashion, one repetition after another.\n\n### While loops\n\nThere is a second sort of loop called a **while loop**. This kind of loop is typically used when the number of iterations is not known in advance. A while loop keeps repeating until the value of a logical expression changes from TRUE to FALSE (changes from 1 to 0). As a little demo, here is an example of a while loop that prints out successive integers starting from 1, until they exceed a critical value, in this case 10:\n\n::: {#2f300f40 .cell execution_count=4}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\ni = 1\nwhile (i < 9):\n    print(f\"i={i}\")\n    i = i + 1\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\ni=1\ni=2\ni=3\ni=4\ni=5\ni=6\ni=7\ni=8\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe expression that determines whether a while loop will continue repeating can be any valid Python expression that evaluates to a boolean (`true` or `false`).\n\nFor both for loops and while loops, there are two keywords to know about that can break you out of a loop (`break`) and can move you to the next iteration of the loop (`continue`). I tend not to use these, but some people find them useful.\n\n# Conditionals\n\nSo far we have seen how to use loops to repeat sections of code over and over again as needed. The other major control flow mechanism in high-level languages is the *conditional*, which allows you to specify how code branches in one direction or another depending on some logical condition.\n\nSo for example let's say you ask the user to enter a number, and if the number is even you output \"The number is even.\" and if the number is odd you output \"The number is odd.\":\n\n::: {#6e40074d .cell execution_count=5}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nx = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\nif ((x % 2) == 0):\n    print(\"The number is even\")\nelse:\n    print(\"The number is odd\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nwhich produces:\n\n```\nEnter a number: 15\nThe number is odd\n```\n\nand\n\n```\nEnter a number: 12\nThe number is even\n```\n\nIn general one can string together any number of `elif` branches (including none of them). For example:\n\n::: {#8b5291ba .cell execution_count=6}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nx = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\nif (x < 10):\n    print(\"The number is less than 10\")\nelif (x < 20):\n    print(\"The number is less than 20\")\nelif (x < 30):\n    print(\"The number is less than 30\")\nelse:\n    print(\"I don't have anything to say\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nYou don't need any `else` statements at all if is suits your needs:\n\n::: {#15b6c0da .cell execution_count=7}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nx = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\nif (x < 0):\n    print(\"That is a negative number\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n",

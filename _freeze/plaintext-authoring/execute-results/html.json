The formatting, like fonts, margins, and line spacing, is something a template or style can handle. It's a nuisance and a time-waster to fiddle with that stuff by hand. The principle of separation of content and style is one of the main rationales of plaintext authoring.\n\n## Word Processors\n\nIn Microsoft Word or Google Docs, content and formatting are entangled. You write a heading by selecting text and making it bold and 14pt. You don't *declare* it as a heading in any structural sense (unless you use Styles, which almost nobody does consistently). The file format (`.docx`) is a zipped bundle of XML that is not human-readable. If Word (or Google) changes how it handles that format, or if you don't have Word, you may not be able to open your own file in 10 years. If something goes wrong with the document you may not be able to \"see\" what changed because formatting and other things are hidden within menus and preferences settings.\n\n## Plaintext\n\nIn a plaintext workflow, you write your content in a simple text file, which is something you can open in Notepad, TextEdit, VS Code, or any other text editor on any computer, today or in 50 years. You mark up structure with lightweight, readable syntax (e.g. [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) or [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/)). Then a separate tool converts that source file into a PDF, HTML page, or even a Word document.\n\nIn the plaintext authoring model your document is:\n\n- portable\n- archivable\n- version-controllable\n- platform-independent\n\n## Journals\n\nHere's the situation:\n\n1. Many journals accept LaTeX submissions directly. In physics, math, CS, and economics, LaTeX is the expected format. In neuroscience, biology, and psychology, it varies, but many journals do accept LaTeX (e.g., Nature, Nature Neuroscience, Science, PNAS, Cell, Neuron, eLife, J Neurosci, J Cogn Neurosci, all the APA journals, SAGE journals, Elsevier journals, Springer journals).\n\n2. Pandoc can convert your Markdown or LaTeX source to `.docx` in one command. You write in plaintext, and when a journal demands Word, you generate a Word file at the end.\n\n3. The real question is: where do you want to spend your time? Formatting in Word, or writing? Chasing down a reference that didn't update, or trusting BibTeX? Emailing `thesis_v3_FINAL_revised_FINAL2.docx` back and forth, or using Git?\n\n4. Your thesis is long. Word can struggle with documents over ~50 pages that contain many figures and cross-references.\n\n5. Google Docs solves the collaboration and platform-independence problems nicely, and for short, simple documents it's fine. But it shares Word's limitation of entangling content and style, it has very limited equation support, it handles citations through third-party add-ons (Zotero, Paperpile), and try reformatting a 200-page Google Doc to a different journal's style. You'll also notice that Google Docs has no real support for cross-references, numbered equations, or figure captions that update automatically.\n\n## Summary\n\n|            Feature            | Word / Google Docs |   Plaintext (Markdown / LaTeX)    |\n| ----------------------------- | ------------------ | --------------------------------- |\n| Human-readable source         | No (binary/XML)    | Yes                               |\n| Version control (Git)         | Difficult          | Natural                           |\n| Separation of content & style | Weak (manual)      | Strong (by design)                |\n| Equation support              | Cumbersome         | Excellent (LaTeX math)            |\n| Citation management           | Plugin-dependent   | Built-in (BibTeX/CSL)             |\n| Long document stability       | Degrades           | Robust                            |\n| Collaboration                 | Good (Google Docs) | Git + plain text diffs / Overleaf |\n| Output flexibility            | One format         | PDF, HTML, Word, slides, ...      |\n| Archival / portability        | Format-dependent   | Plain text lasts forever          |\n| Typographic quality           | Acceptable         | Superior (LaTeX)                  |\n\n\n# Markdown\n\nMarkdown is a lightweight markup language created by [John Gruber](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) in 2004. It was designed to be readable as-is. The idea is that you shouldn't need to \"compile\" it to understand what the author meant.\n\n## Syntax\n\nHere is what a Markdown document looks like:\n\n```markdown\n# My Research Paper\n\n## Introduction\n\nThis is a paragraph of text. You can make words **bold** or *italic*.\nYou can also include `inline code` for variable names or filenames.\n\nHere is a list of things:\n\n- First item\n- Second item\n- Third item\n\nAnd a numbered list:\n\n1. Do the experiment\n2. Analyze the data\n3. Write it up\n\n## Methods\n\nWe recruited 24 participants (12 female, mean age = 22.3 years).\nStimuli were presented using PsychoPy [@peirce2019psychopy].\n\n### Apparatus\n\nThe display was a 24-inch monitor at 60 Hz.\n\n## Results\n\nReaction times are shown in Table 1 and Figure 1.\n```\n\nThat's it. It's just text with some punctuation conventions.\n\n## Key Elements\n\n| Element | Syntax | Renders as |\n|---|---|---|\n| Heading 1 | `# Title` | Large heading |\n| Heading 2 | `## Section` | Section heading |\n| Heading 3 | `### Subsection` | Subsection heading |\n| Bold | `**bold**` | **bold** |\n| Italic | `*italic*` | *italic* |\n| Inline code | `` `code` `` | `code` |\n| Link | `[text](url)` | clickable link |\n| Image | `![caption](path.png)` | embedded image |\n| Blockquote | `> quoted text` | indented quote |\n| Horizontal rule | `---` | divider line |\n\n## Extensions\n\nPandoc (which we'll meet next) extends basic Markdown with features essential for academic writing:\n\n- **Citations**: `[@smith2020]` or `@smith2020` \n- **Footnotes**: `^[This is a footnote.]`\n- **Math**: `$E = mc^2$` for inline, `$$\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i$$` for display\n- **Figure captions**: `![Caption text](figure.png){width=80%}`\n- **Tables with captions**\n- **Cross-references** (with filters like pandoc-crossref)\n- **YAML metadata blocks** for title, author, date, and formatting options\n\n## Resources\n\n- Markdown basics: <https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/>\n- Pandoc's Markdown extensions: <https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#pandocs-markdown>\n- Practice: <https://www.markdowntutorial.com/> (interactive, takes ~15 minutes)\n\n---\n\n# Pandoc\n\n[Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) is a command-line tool created by Professor or Philosophy (and programmer) [John MacFarlane](https://johnmacfarlane.net). It converts between dozens of document formats, e.g.:\n\nMarkdown → PDF, Word, HTML, LaTeX (and back)\n\n## Installation\n\n- macOS: `brew install pandoc` (via Homebrew) or download from <https://pandoc.org/installing.html>\n- Windows (WSL/Ubuntu): `sudo apt install pandoc`\n- Or download the latest release directly: <https://github.com/jgc/pandoc/releases> → actually: <https://github.com/jgc/pandoc/releases> — use <https://pandoc.org/installing.html>\n\nYou also need a LaTeX distribution for PDF output (Pandoc uses LaTeX under the hood to make PDFs):\n\n- macOS: `brew install --cask mactex` or the smaller `brew install --cask basictex`\n- WSL/Ubuntu: `sudo apt install texlive-full` (large, ~5 GB) or `sudo apt install texlive-latex-recommended texlive-fonts-recommended texlive-latex-extra` (smaller)\n\nA lightweight alternative to a full LaTeX install is [Tectonic](https://tectonic-typesetting.github.io/), which auto-downloads only the packages it needs.\n\n## Usage\n\n```bash\n# Markdown to PDF\npandoc paper.md -o paper.pdf\n\n# Markdown to Word\npandoc paper.md -o paper.docx\n\n# Markdown to HTML\npandoc paper.md -o paper.html\n\n# Markdown to LaTeX (to inspect or edit the .tex source)\npandoc paper.md -o paper.tex\n```\n\nPandoc infers the output format from the file extension.\n\n## YAML Metadata\n\nAt the top of your Markdown file, you can add a [YAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML) metadata block:\n\n```yaml\n---\ntitle: \"Reaction Time Effects of Sleep Deprivation\"\nauthor: \"Jane Smith\"\ndate: \"2025-01-15\"\nabstract: |\n  We investigated the effects of 24 hours of sleep deprivation\n  on simple and choice reaction times in 48 participants ...\nbibliography: references.bib\ncsl: apa.csl\ngeometry: margin=1in\nfontsize: 12pt\n---\n```\n\nThis tells Pandoc the title, author, which bibliography file to use, which citation style (CSL) to apply, and basic page geometry — all without touching a GUI.\n\n## Citations\n\nPandoc uses a `.bib` file (BibTeX format) for references. You can export `.bib` files from Zotero, Mendeley, Google Scholar, or write them by hand.\n\nA `.bib` entry looks like this:\n\n```bibtex\n@article{smith2020sleep,\n  author  = {Smith, Jane and Doe, John},\n  title   = {Sleep deprivation and reaction time},\n  journal = {Journal of Sleep Research},\n  year    = {2020},\n  volume  = {29},\n  pages   = {e13045},\n  doi     = {10.1111/jsr.13045}\n}\n```\n\nIn your Markdown, you cite it as `[@smith2020sleep]`, and Pandoc replaces that with a formatted citation (e.g., \"(Smith & Doe, 2020)\") and generates the bibliography automatically.\n\nTo compile with citations:\n\n```bash\npandoc paper.md --citeproc -o paper.pdf\n```\n\nThe `--citeproc` flag tells Pandoc to process citations. The citation style is controlled by the `csl:` field in your YAML header. You can download thousands of CSL styles from <https://www.zotero.org/styles> (APA, Vancouver, Harvard, Nature, IEEE, etc.).\n\n## Resources\n\n- Pandoc user's guide: <https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html>\n- Pandoc getting started: <https://pandoc.org/getting-started.html>\n- Citation Style Language styles: <https://www.zotero.org/styles>\n- BibTeX entry types: <https://www.bibtex.com/e/entry-types/>\n\n## Exercise 1 {#sec-exercise1}\n\n### Setup\n\nMake sure you have Pandoc and a LaTeX distribution installed (see above).\n\nDownload the [files/plaintext-exercises.tgz](files/plaintext-exercises.tgz) archive, move it to your `Psych_9040/` directory, and then unpack it:\n\n```{bash}\n$ tar -xvzf plaintext-exercises.tgz\n```\n\nThis is what it looks like:\n\n```{bash}\n$ tree -F plaintext-exercises\n```\n\n```\nplaintext-exercises/\n├── exercise1/\n│   ├── exercise1.md\n│   ├── refs.bib\n│   └── TASKS.md\n├── exercise2/\n│   ├── exercise2.tex\n│   ├── refs.bib\n│   ├── sample_figure.pdf\n│   ├── sample_figure.png\n│   └── TASKS.md\n├── exercise3/\n│   ├── exercise3.md\n│   ├── refs.bib\n│   ├── search_figure.pdf\n│   ├── search_figure.png\n│   └── TASKS.md\n├── README.md\n└── setup.sh\n```\n\nNow run the `setup.sh` script which downloads a `.csl` file that will be used for APA-style citations:\n\n```{bash}\n$ bash setup.sh\n```\n\n```\nDownloading APA 7th edition citation style...\nCopying apa.csl into exercise folders...\n  → exercise1/apa.csl\n  → exercise2/apa.csl\n  → exercise3/apa.csl\n\nDone! You're ready for the exercises.\n```\n\nFor this exercise we will be using the files in the `exercise1/` directory:\n\n### Task\n\nYou are given a starter file `exercise1.md` (see below). Your tasks:\n\n1. **Read** the file in a text editor. Notice how readable it is even as raw text.\n2. **Compile** it to PDF: `pandoc exercise1.md --citeproc -o exercise1.pdf`\n3. **Compile** it to Word: `pandoc exercise1.md --citeproc -o exercise1.docx`\n4. Open both outputs. Compare them to the source.\n5. **Add the following to the document:**\n   - A new subsection under Methods called `### Data Analysis`\n   - A sentence describing the analysis, citing a new reference (add it to the `.bib` file)\n   - An inline equation: the formula for a t-statistic, $t = \\frac{\\bar{X} - \\mu}{s / \\sqrt{n}}$\n   - Recompile to PDF and verify your additions appear correctly.\n\n**Hint**: writing equations in LaTeX can be strange at first, they have a syntax/grammar all their own, but once you get the hang of it, it's actually pretty easy and very efficient. Here is some documentation: [LaTeX Mathematics](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Mathematics).\n\n### Starter File\n\n`exercise1.md`\n\n```markdown\n---\ntitle: \"Effects of Caffeine on Grip Strength\"\nauthor: \"A.

We will look at how to write LaTeX directly (useful for when you need fine-grained control), how to handle equations, figures, tables, and cross-references, and how to use Overleaf for collaborative LaTeX editing. Many people write LaTeX directly, bypassing Markdown and Pandoc altogether. Historical note: I wrote my very first journal article in LaTeX back in 1994, and today it is still viewable, editable, and compiles to pdf, using free and open source tools.\n\nFor next time:\n\n1. Verify that your LaTeX distribution is working: try `pdflatex --version` in your terminal.\n2. Create a free account on [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/), we will use it for an exercise.\n3. (Optional) Work through the interactive Markdown tutorial: <https://www.markdowntutorial.com/>\n\n---\n\n# LaTeX\n\n## What/Why?\n\nLaTeX (pronounced \"LAH-tek\" or \"LAY-tek\") is a typesetting system created by Leslie Lamport in 1984, built on top of Donald Knuth's TeX (1978). Knuth, a computer scientist, created TeX because he was unhappy with the typographic quality of his textbooks. LaTeX adds a layer of convenience on top of TeX.\n\nWhen you compile a LaTeX document, the system makes thousands of micro-decisions about line breaks, hyphenation, spacing, and page layout. The result is typographically excellent output, the kind of polished, professional look you see in textbooks and journal articles.\n\nWord processors like Microsoft Word, or Google Docs, or Apple's Pages, are written to make some typographic \"decisions\" but the truth is that they pale in comparison to the polished professional look you get using LaTeX.\n\n### Pandoc & LaTeX\n\nWhen you ran `pandoc paper.md -o paper.pdf` above, Pandoc actually:\n\n1. Converted your Markdown to LaTeX behind the scenes\n2. Called `pdflatex` (or `xelatex`) to compile the LaTeX to PDF\n\nSo you've already been using LaTeX. You just had Pandoc as a middleman. Learning LaTeX directly gives you much finer control when you need it. It also removes one layer of dependency/complexity from the process.\n\n### Which one?\n\n|              Scenario               |                       Recommendation                       |\n| ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Short paper, simple structure       | Markdown + Pandoc                                          |\n| Blog post, course notes, README     | Markdown + Pandoc                                          |\n| Thesis or dissertation              | LaTeX directly (or Markdown for drafting, LaTeX for final) |\n| complex equations                   | LaTeX directly                                             |\n| precise figure placement            | LaTeX directly                                             |\n| numbered figures, equations, tables | LaTeX directly                                             |\n| Journal provides a LaTeX template   | LaTeX directly                                             |\n| Need Word output for a journal      | Markdown + Pandoc (convert to .docx)                       |\n| Quick first draft                   | Markdown + Pandoc                                          |\n\nMany working scientists use a hybrid: draft quickly in Markdown, then move to LaTeX when the document matures and needs fine-tuning.\n\n## Document Structure\n\nA LaTeX document has two parts: the **preamble** (setup and configuration) and the **document body** (your content).\n\n### Minimal Example {#sec-minimal-example}\n\n```latex\n\\documentclass[12pt]{article}\n\n% --- Preamble: load packages and configure ---\n\\usepackage[margin=1in]{geometry}\n\\usepackage{amsmath}          % better equation support\n\\usepackage{graphicx}         % for including figures\n\\usepackage{booktabs}         % for professional tables\n\\usepackage[\n  backend=biber,\n  style=apa,\n  natbib=true\n]{biblatex}                   % citation management\n\\addbibresource{refs.bib}\n\n\\title{Effects of Caffeine on Grip Strength}\n\\author{A.\\ Student}\n\\date{February 2025}\n\n% --- Document body ---\n\\begin{document}\n\\maketitle\n\n\\begin{abstract}\nWe investigated the effect of 200\\,mg caffeine on maximal\ngrip strength in a double-blind placebo-controlled design.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\nCaffeine is the most widely consumed psychoactive substance\nin the world \\citep{fredholm1999actions}.

It's a similar idea to Python libraries.\n\n**Comments** start with `%` and are ignored by the compiler.\n\n### Compiling\n\n```bash\n# Basic compilation\npdflatex paper.tex\n\n# With bibliography (requires multiple passes)\npdflatex paper.tex\nbiber paper\npdflatex paper.tex\npdflatex paper.tex\n\n# Or use latexmk, which automates the multiple passes:\nlatexmk -pdf paper.tex\n```\n\nThe multiple passes are needed because LaTeX resolves cross-references and citations iteratively. `latexmk` handles this automatically and is the recommended way to compile.\n\n## Equations\n\nThis is where LaTeX truly shines. The equation syntax is the same whether you're writing in LaTeX or in Markdown+Pandoc (because Pandoc passes math through to LaTeX).\n\n### Inline Math\n\nSurround with single dollar signs:\n\n```latex\nThe sample mean is $\\bar{x} = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i$.\n```\n\n### Display Math\n\nUse the `equation` environment for numbered equations:\n\n```latex\n\\begin{equation}\n  t = \\frac{\\bar{X} - \\mu_0}{s / \\sqrt{n}}\n  \\label{eq:ttest}\n\\end{equation}\n```\n\nYou can then refer to it with `Equation~\\ref{eq:ttest}`.\n\nFor unnumbered equations use `\\[` and `\\]` brackets:\n\n```latex\n\\[\n  \\chi^2 = \\sum \\frac{(O_i - E_i)^2}{E_i}\n\\]\n```\n\n### Multi-Line Equations\n\n```latex\n\\begin{align}\n  \\text{SS}_{\\text{total}} &= \\text{SS}_{\\text{between}}\n                              + \\text{SS}_{\\text{within}} \\\\\n  F &= \\frac{\\text{MS}_{\\text{between}}}\n             {\\text{MS}_{\\text{within}}}\n\\end{align}\n```\n\n### Quick Reference\n\n|     What you want     |           LaTeX code            |  Renders as   |\n| --------------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------- |\n| Greek letters         | `\\alpha, \\beta, \\mu, \\sigma`    | α, β, μ, σ    |\n| Subscript             | `x_{i}`                         | xᵢ            |\n| Superscript           | `x^{2}`                         | x²            |\n| Fraction              | `\\frac{a}{b}`                   | a/b (stacked) |\n| Square root           | `\\sqrt{n}`                      | √n            |\n| Sum                   | `\\sum_{i=1}^{n}`                | Σ             |\n| Integral              | `\\int_{0}^{\\infty}`             | ∫             |\n| Hat/bar               | `\\hat{\\beta}, \\bar{x}`          | β̂, x̄          |\n| Approximately         | `\\approx`                       | ≈             |\n| Less/greater or equal | `\\leq, \\geq`                    | ≤, ≥          |\n| Partial derivative    | `\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}` | ∂f/∂x         |\n\n### Resources\n\n- Detexify — draw a symbol and it tells you the LaTeX code: <https://detexify.kirelabs.org/>\n- LaTeX math cheat sheet: <https://katex.org/docs/supported>\n- The `amsmath` package documentation covers everything: <https://mirrors.ctan.org/macros/latex/required/amsmath/amsldoc.pdf>\n\n## Figures & Tables\n\n### Figures\n\n```latex\n\\begin{figure}[htbp]\n  \\centering\n  \\includegraphics[width=0.8\\textwidth]{figures/grip_strength.pdf}\n  \\caption{Mean grip strength (N) by condition. Error bars show\n           $\\pm 1$ SE.}\n  \\label{fig:grip}\n\\end{figure}\n```\n\nKey points:\n\n- `[htbp]` = placement preference: **h**ere, **t**op of page, **b**ottom, separate **p**age. LaTeX decides the best placement. (This is a feature, not a bug; LaTeX optimizes page layout globally.)\n- Use PDF or PNG for figures. PDF is preferred for vector graphics (plots), PNG for raster images (e.g. photos, microscopy).\n- Reference with `Figure~\\ref{fig:grip}` ; the number updates automatically.\n- The tilde `~` prevents a line break between \"Figure\" and the number.\n\n### Tables\n\n```latex\n\\begin{table}[htbp]\n  \\centering\n  \\caption{Mean grip strength (N) by condition and time point.}\n  \\label{tab:results}\n  \\begin{tabular}{lcc}\n    \\toprule\n    Condition & Pre & Post \\\\\n    \\midrule\n    Caffeine  & 38.2 (5.1) & 40.5 (5.3) \\\\\n    Placebo   & 37.9 (4.8) & 38.3 (5.0) \\\\\n    \\bottomrule\n  \\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\n```\n\nKey points:\n\n- `{lcc}` = three columns: left-aligned, center, center.\n- `\\toprule`, `\\midrule`, `\\bottomrule` come from the `booktabs` package and produce clean, professional horizontal rules (no vertical lines — this is a typographic best practice).\n- Reference with `Table~\\ref{tab:results}`.\n\nPandoc Markdown tables are simpler but less flexible:\n\n```markdown\n| Condition | Pre        | Post       |\n|-----------|------------|------------|\n| Caffeine  | 38.2 (5.1) | 40.5 (5.3) |\n| Placebo   | 37.9 (4.8) | 38.3 (5.0) |\n\n: Mean grip strength (N) by condition and time point. {#tbl:results}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Exercise 2\n\nIn this exercise you will practice building a LaTeX document.\n\nMake sure you have completed the setup described in @sec-exercise1. \n\nFor this exercise we will be using the files in the `exercise2/` directory:\n\n### Option A: Overleaf\n\n(Recommended for First-Timers)\n\n1. Go to <https://www.overleaf.com/> and log in.\n2. Create a new blank project.\n3. Start with the minimal template from @sec-minimal-example above.\n4. **Complete these tasks:**\n\n**Task 1 — Equations**: Add a \"Data Analysis\" subsection under Methods. Include the formula for Pearson's correlation coefficient as a numbered equation:\n\n$$r = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \\bar{x})(y_i - \\bar{y})}{\\sqrt{\\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \\bar{x})^2 \\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \\bar{y})^2}}$$\n\nThen reference it in the text (\"... as shown in Equation 1\").\n\n**Task 2 — Table**: Add a Results table with three columns (Measure, Caffeine, Placebo) and at least two rows. Use `booktabs` rules. Add a caption and label, and reference the table in the text.\n\n**Task 3 — Figure**: Download any plot image (or use a placeholder) and include it as a figure with a caption. Reference it in the text. (On Overleaf, use the upload button to add an image file.)\n\n**Task 4 — Citation**: Add a new entry to `refs.bib` and cite it somewhere in the text. Verify it appears in the bibliography.\n\n### Option B: Locally\n\nSame tasks, but compile locally:\n\n```bash\nlatexmk -pdf exercise2.tex\n```\n\nIf you don't have `latexmk`, use:\n\n```bash\npdflatex exercise2.tex\nbiber exercise2\npdflatex exercise2.tex\npdflatex exercise2.tex\n```\n\n### Debrief\n\n- How did the equation-writing experience compare to Word's equation editor?\n- What happened when you changed the placement hint on your figure from `[h]` to `[t]`?\n- How did adding a citation and recompiling feel compared to managing references in a GUI?\n\n---\n\n## Overleaf\n\n[Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) deserves special mention because it addresses the most common objection to LaTeX: collaboration. Overleas is a collaborative LaTeX in the browser much like Google Docs.\n\n- **Real-time collaboration** like Google Docs — multiple people can edit simultaneously\n- **No local installation required** — everything compiles in the cloud\n- **Rich library of templates** for journals, theses, CVs, posters: <https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates>\n- **Git integration** on paid plans — you can push/pull your Overleaf project to a Git repo\n- **Track changes and comments** — familiar to Word users\n- **Free tier** is generous for individual use; paid plans add more collaborators\n\nMany universities provide institutional Overleaf subscriptions. Unfortunately at present Western does not.\n\nFor students who may not write LaTeX daily, Overleaf significantly lowers the barrier to entry. You get the typographic quality and structural rigor of LaTeX with a Google Docs-like editing experience.\n\n## A Workflow\n\nHere are three practical workflows you might adopt:\n\n### Workflow 1: Markdown + Pandoc (Simplest)\n\nBest for: drafts, short papers, course assignments, people who want minimal setup.\n\n```\npaper.md + refs.bib → pandoc → paper.pdf or paper.docx\n```\n\n### Workflow 2: LaTeX on Overleaf (Collaborative)\n\nBest for: thesis chapters, papers with co-authors, when a journal provides a LaTeX template.\n\n```\npaper.tex + refs.bib → Overleaf (cloud) → paper.pdf\n```\n\n### Workflow 3: LaTeX Locally with Git (Maximum Control)\n\nBest for: advanced users, large projects, integration with data analysis pipelines.\n\n```\npaper.tex + refs.bib → latexmk → paper.pdf\n         ↑\n    version controlled with Git\n```\n\n### Workflow 4: Hybrid (Common in Practice)\n\nDraft in Markdown (fast, low friction), then convert to LaTeX when the paper matures and you need fine-tuned formatting or a journal template.\n\n```\ndraft.md → pandoc → paper.tex → edit in LaTeX → paper.pdf\n```\n\nAll four approaches keep your source as plaintext. All four let you use Git. All four separate content from presentation.\n\n\n## Exercise 3\n\nA Full Pipeline\n\n### Task\n\nFrom a Markdown draft to polished output documents.\n\nYou are given a Markdown file representing a short paper. Your tasks:\n\n1. **Compile to PDF** with Pandoc. Inspect the output.\n2. **Compile to Word** with Pandoc. Open in Word. Confirm it looks reasonable.\n3. **Compile to LaTeX** with `pandoc exercise3.md -o exercise3.tex`. Open the `.tex` file and look at what Pandoc generated.\n4. **Edit the `.tex` file**: adjust figure placement, tweak table formatting, or add a LaTeX-specific feature like `\\pagebreak`.\n5. **Compile the edited `.tex` to PDF**: `latexmk -pdf exercise3.tex`\n\n### Starter File\n\n`exercise3.md`\n\n```markdown\n---\ntitle: \"Visual Search Asymmetry in Threat Detection\"\nauthor: \"A. Student\"\ndate: \"2025-02-15\"\nabstract: |\n  We tested whether threatening stimuli (snakes) are detected\n  faster than non-threatening stimuli (flowers) in a visual\n  search task. Results supported the threat superiority effect.\nbibliography: refs3.bib\ncsl: apa.csl\ngeometry: margin=1in\nfontsize: 12pt\n---\n\n# Introduction\n\nThe threat superiority effect refers to the faster detection of\nthreatening stimuli in visual search [@ohman2001fears]. This has\nbeen demonstrated for snakes [@ohman2001fears], spiders\n[@rakison2009does], and angry faces [@fox2000facial].\n\n# Methods\n\n## Participants\n\nForty undergraduate students (28 female, mean age = 19.8,\nSD = 1.2) participated for course credit.\n\n## Stimuli and Design\n\nSearch displays contained 8 items arranged in a circle. On\ntarget-present trials, one item was the target (snake or flower)\namong 7 distractors (mushrooms). We used a 2 (target: snake,\nflower) × 2 (target presence: present, absent) design.\n\n## Data Analysis\n\nReaction times shorter than 200 ms or longer than 2000 ms were\nexcluded (1.8% of trials). We computed mean RTs for correct\nresponses and analyzed them with a repeated-measures ANOVA:\n\n$$F = \\frac{MS_{between}}{MS_{within}}$$\n\n# Results\n\nMean reaction times are shown in Table 1.\n\n| Target  | Present     | Absent      |\n|---------|-------------|-------------|\n| Snake   | 612 (89)    | 831 (102)   |\n| Flower  | 698 (94)    | 854 (110)   |\n\n: Mean reaction times in ms (SD in parentheses). {#tbl:rts}\n\nThere was a significant main effect of target type,\n$F(1, 39) = 14.2$, $p < .001$, $\\eta_p^2 = .27$.\n\n# Discussion\n\nOur findings replicate the threat superiority effect\n[@ohman2001fears]. Snake targets were detected approximately\n86 ms faster than flower targets.\n\n# References\n```\n\n### Debrief\n\n- You just went from one source file to three output formats in about 60 seconds of terminal commands.\n- You then had the option to \"eject\" to LaTeX for fine-tuning.

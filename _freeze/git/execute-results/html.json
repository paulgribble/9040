Open up a terminal and type:\n\n```{bash}\ngit --version\n```\n\nand you should get something like:\n\n```{bash}\ngit version 2.34.0\n```\n\nIt doesn't much matter if the version number isn't identical to the one above.\n\n## Tutorials / Intros\n\n- [about GitHub and Git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/about-github-and-git) by GitHub docs\n- [git-novice](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/) by software carpentry\n- [hello world](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/hello-world) by GitHub docs\n- [Git Cheat Sheet](https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf) by GitHub Education\n- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) project page\n- [Version Control and Git](https://mptc.io/content/08-content-git.html) by Kieran Healy\n\n",

Python has several libraries that can be used for generating graphics. The most popular ones are `matplotlib` and `seaborn`.

# Matplotlib

- Matplotlib: [tutorials](https://matplotlib.org/stable/tutorials/index)
- [The Python Graph Gallery](https://www.python-graph-gallery.com/)

Matplotlib is more or less a copy of MATLAB's plotting capabilities, so if you are familiar with MATLAB, you will feel at home with matplotlib. Seaborn is a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics. It's a little bit like `ggplot2` in R.

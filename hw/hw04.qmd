Due: Feb 8 by 11:59 pm eastern standard time

Submit a single file called `name_04.py` to Brightspace/OWL where `name` is replaced with your last name, e.g. `gribble_04.py`

---

Choose any one of the "Slighly more challenging problems" listed in the [Advent of Code coding exercises](https://gribblelab.org/coding/challenges/advent_of_code.html). Write a Python script to complete both part 1 and part 2 of the problem you choose. Submit only your code, you don't need to submit your puzzle input.

If you are already Python experienced and you want to try one of the "more challenging problems" instead, that would be fine as well.

If you have never programmed anything before this course and you wish to choose one of the "Easiest problems" that would be ok as well.

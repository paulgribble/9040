Due: Mar 8 by 11:59 pm eastern standard time

Submit your source file (`paper.md` or `paper.tex`), your `refs.bib` file, and the compiled PDF to Brightspace/OWL.

## Background

You have been given a Word document ([`convert_this.docx`](convert_this.docx)) containing a short
scientific paper about sleep restriction and postural sway. It's the kind of
document a student might produce in Word: functional, but fragile.

Open it in Word, LibreOffice, or Google Docs and take a look. Then examine it
critically. You'll notice several problems that are typical of Word-based
scientific writing:

- **Headings** are faked with bold/large text rather than structural heading styles
- **Citations** are manually typed strings, not linked to a reference manager
- **The equation** is typed as plain monospaced text, not a real equation
- **The reference list** is typed by hand with inconsistent formatting across entries
  (some have DOIs, some don't; one uses Vancouver style instead of APA; one is
  missing the hanging indent; one is missing a period)
- **The table** uses heavy gridlines rather than clean formatting

None of these would survive a format change, a journal resubmission, or the
passage of time particularly well.

## Your Task

Recreate this document, either in Markdown+Pandoc, or in LaTeX (your choice),
fixing all of the problems above along the way.

Specifically, your converted document must include:

### 1. Proper structure
- Use real headings (`#` / `##` in Markdown, or `\section{}` / `\subsection{}` in LaTeX)
- Include YAML metadata (Markdown) or a proper preamble (LaTeX) with title, author, and date

### 2. Real citations and bibliography
- Create a `refs.bib` file containing all five references from the paper
- Replace every manually typed citation with a proper citation key
  (e.g., `[@cappuccio2010sleep]` in Markdown or `\citep{cappuccio2010sleep}` in LaTeX)
- The bibliography should be generated automatically in APA format

> **Tip**: You can find BibTeX entries on Google Scholar → click Cite → click BibTeX.
> Or search for the paper on <https://scholar.google.com> and export the entry.

### 3. Proper equations
Replace the plain-text equation with real LaTeX math. The document contains:

- Cohen's d (display equation)
- The pooled standard deviation formula (inline)

These should become something like:

```
$$d = \frac{M_1 - M_2}{SD_{\text{pooled}}}$$
```

and

```
$SD_{\text{pooled}} = \sqrt{\frac{SD_1^2 + SD_2^2}{2}}$
```

### 4. A clean table
Recreate the results table using proper markup:

- In Markdown: a pipe table with a caption
- In LaTeX: a `tabular` inside a `table` environment with `booktabs` rules
  (`\toprule`, `\midrule`, `\bottomrule` — no vertical lines)

### 5. Compile to PDF
- **Markdown**: `pandoc paper.md --citeproc -o paper.pdf`
- **LaTeX**: `latexmk -pdf paper.tex`

## What to Submit

1. Your source file (`paper.md` or `paper.tex`)
2. Your bibliography file (`refs.bib`)
3. Your compiled output (`paper.pdf`)

## Grading

This is a completion-based assignment. Full marks if:

- [ ] The document compiles to PDF without errors
- [ ] Headings are structurally correct (not faked with bold text)
- [ ] All five citations use BibTeX keys and the bibliography is auto-generated
- [ ] The equations are rendered in LaTeX math
- [ ] The table is well formatted

## Hints

- You do **not** need to match the Word document's appearance exactly. The point is
  to produce a *better* version using plaintext tools.
- If using Markdown+Pandoc, remember to include `--citeproc` and to specify
  `bibliography: refs.bib` and `csl: apa.csl` in your YAML header.
- If using LaTeX, `biblatex` with `biber` and `style=apa` will handle APA formatting.
- The APA CSL file can be downloaded from <https://www.zotero.org/styles/apa>.
- If you are skilled with these kinds of tools this assignment should take you about 15 minutes. If you're spending much longer, ask for help. If you haven't read through the course notes on ([plaintext authoring](../plaintext-authoring.qmd)) and completed the exercises, do that first.
